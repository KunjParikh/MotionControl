1) Hessian Estimation
2) MakeFile for sbatch
3) reset states before each new LSTM training
4) Add error metric to test.
 - Thought of area inside curve using green's algorithm > Curve is cycled multiple times in 10000 steps so overcount.
 > Implemented using z_desired vs measured value at all points, and mean squared error.
   - Have to truncate initial points when we are still approaching the curve. For now filtering out initial points until we are 1.1 (10% of z_desired).
5) Test on something not trained
